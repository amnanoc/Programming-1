# Programming 1

This repository contains all the assignments I completed for the Programming 1 course at KTH. The assignments are written in Java and are console applications. The first five tasks are mandatory assignments that demonstrate my general knowledge of Java, while the remaining four tasks are higher-level assignments with special tasks that showcase my expertise.

## Getting Started

To use the projects, simply download the assignments and run them in an IDE of your choice, such as IntelliJ or Eclipse.
